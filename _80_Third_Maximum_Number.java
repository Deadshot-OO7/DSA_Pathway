/*
* Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.

* WHY WE NEEDED TREESET HERE :-
*
* Using a TreeSet for this problem is beneficial because it automatically handles duplicates and keeps the elements sorted. Hereâ€™s how TreeSet can simplify finding the third distinct maximum number:

Automatic Sorting: A TreeSet stores elements in a sorted order. This means that once you add all the elements from the array to the TreeSet, the highest elements are naturally at the end of the set.

Handling Duplicates: A TreeSet does not allow duplicate values. This ensures that only distinct elements are stored, which is crucial for this problem since you need to find distinct maximum numbers.

Efficient Operations: TreeSet provides efficient methods like last() and pollLast() to get or remove the highest elements.
